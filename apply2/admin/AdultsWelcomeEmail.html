                        <li>Middlesex Championship League &shy; Division 1 (1st  XI)</li>
                        <li>Middlesex County Cricket League &shy; Division 2 (2nd  XI)</li>

					  <p>Cup Competitions  run parallel to the regular league season. We also provide coaching through  ex&shy;Frist Class Cricketers who are also ECB Level 2 Qualified Coaches. All coaches  have been screened for their suitability for working with our members and children.</p>
                      <p>
Osterley Cricket  Club has achieved its Club Mark Status on 2nd November 2009  (No:01474). ECB  Clubmark is the ECB&rsquo;s club accreditation scheme for clubs with junior sections.  ECB Clubmark sets out required standards across four areas: </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Duty of Care and Safeguarding Children</li>
                        <li>The Cricket Programme we offer</li>
                        <li>Knowing your club and its Community &shy; One Game </li>
                        <li>Club Management. </li>
                      </ul>
                        <p>Achieving ECB  Clubmark accreditation is an acknowledgement that we take these issues  seriously and that we are striving to provide a high quality and welcoming  environment for young participants in cricket. We welcome parents and carers or  guardians and all adult members to all training and competitions and value your  support.Â  </p>
                      <p>Below is some  information about training times and dates, and details regarding travel  arrangements, kits and membership.</p>
                        <p><strong>Training Sessions</strong> take place throughout  the season and during the winter months. Your team captain or club  representative will be able to inform you of the timings and dates for when  these are scheduled. You will be notified through email/phone/social media or the Coach/Captain as  to when you should attend your sessions. </p>
                        <p>Winter nets are due to end by the first  week of April every year after which we move back to the Club and outdoor  training, which you will be informed about.</p>
<p>Arrangements  should be made for your travel to and from training sessions and league or cup matches.  We would appreciate it if you can arrive promptly and are collected promptly at  the end of every session, if you are not making your own way home. </p>
<p><strong>Club Training Kits</strong> consist of a  complete tracksuit with the Osterley CC Emblem along with a set of  Whites and Sweater for Matches. Whites have to be worn for all league games as well as cup  games, as required by the Laws of the game and the relative competitions. The  cost for each Kit per adult is included in your annual subscription fees and can be collected from the  Clubhouse before the start of the season. </p>
<p><strong>Annual Membership Fee</strong> for adults is &pound;150  per person, which has to be paid for every season you play for Osterley CC.  Every season starts and ends in October of every year. If you participate in  Open Age/Adult Cricket there are match fees that are covered in the Pricing  Policy on the club website which is <a href="www.osterleycc.com">www.osterleycc.com</a>.</p>
<p>  We are grateful  to you for submitting your membership and making the yearly subs payment. For safety reasons it is important  that the club is informed of any medical condition or allergies that may be  relevant should you fall ill or be involved in an accident at the club.</p>
<p>If you would  like to talk to someone at the club about this information or your involvement  with the club, please contact me on 07774573622 or e-mail me on <a href="mailto:omer@osterleycc.com">omer@osterleycc.com</a>.</p>
